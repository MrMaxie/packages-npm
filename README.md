# @MaxieDev

A curated collection of npm packages designed for seamless integration and scalability in modern software projects. Each of thes packages is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly customizable. But they too small to be a standalone repository - it's easier to maintain them from a single place.

## Packages

| Package | Version | Description |
| [**events**](./packages/events) | 1.0.0 | Event emitter with strong typing, async support, but without covering the basic EventEmitter API |
